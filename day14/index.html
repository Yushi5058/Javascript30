    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[5] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
        // it will always go back to the reference which is not
    // the same as strings, numbers and booleans.

        // make a copy instead 
    const team2 = players.slice();
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[5] = 'heeee haw';
    console.log(team4);


    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
