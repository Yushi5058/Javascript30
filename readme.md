# Javascript30 by Wesbos

[Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/) is a challenge created by Wesbos,
a well-known teacher and YouTuber who has plenty of videos about web development.
I began this project on 21st march 2023, and despite many days where
I procrastined and did small or no progress at all in these courses, I managed
to finish that challenge on the 4th of may 2023.

# What I have learnt
I learned how to use vanilla javascript in if not all of its aspects, some of
the usual ones in the frontend industry ranging from listeners to functions
and variables, and also how to manipulate booleans for many functions.
I also learned how to break a project into smaller steps to have an easier
understanding of the problem and the solution we're searching for to solve
that problem. I also learned how to debug things from a senior programmer
perspective thanks to Wesbos.
The overall experience was great and enjoyable, and I can't wait to learn
more things about javascript, or other programming-related topics. I'm excited
about what's yet to come in the future in my self-taught learning journey.

A huge thanks to Websos for making this learning resource accessible for
everyone willing to learn and curious about javascript.
